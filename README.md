# Helix
A number based programming language using python as a compiler
or at least i think thats what it is


# Overview

  Helix is made in python, not sure if it counts as a programing language,
  And only uses numbers and symbols, no letters required!

  It can read code a bit slower than python, has a debug mode ( if you can even call it that )
  inside the python file, its a variable cause this was made awhile back, and is prone to breaking
  mostly just putting up all the old changes i forgot to commit, might come back to it with my new found programming skills!


# Limitations

  Helix cant use nested "If Statments", due to once again, dumb old me.
  
  The Cyclomatic Complexity of this program is 27, Twenty fucking Seven, what was i thinking when i made this.

  There is no built in While loop, you will have to make one with "goto" statments, Sorry :(

  You can only code in the main.hx file, cause i have yet to implement directory searching for .hx files


# Future Stuff

  Once again, i might pick this back up, and do it properly in visual studio,
  and not repl.it, seeing how i own a computer now.
