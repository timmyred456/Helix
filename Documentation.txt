Helix is a programming language (ish?) made with and on python.

Helix is number based, meaning that all code is mostly just numbers, and no text

this means that if the first letter of any line is not an operator (i.e numbers 1-10) then
Helix will ignore it and carry on with the rest of the code.

Operators are special numbers or letters that are used to do certin things such as:

  Compare values in if statments
  
  Add to a variable
  
  Times a variable by another number
  
  ect.

if you want to use a variable do: 1,(variable name) this lets helix know your searching for a variable and not using a number


They are used in more complex modules like math and the if statment modules

All Finished functions:

  1 ~ set variable
               |
    Structure:   1 44 10 <--- variable Value
                    |
                    variable Name 

  2 ~ print variable
                    |
     Structure:  2 44 <--- Variable Name


  3 ~ Math Functions |Value to use with the operator
                   |    |     
         Structure 3 44 1 ? <- operator
                      |
      Variable to do math on

      Math is one of the more complex modules, it uses 4 diffrent operators 
      
      All of the math module operators are as follows:
        + ~ adds to the variable
        - ~ Subtracts from the variable
        * ~ Times the variable by the Value
        / ~ Divides the variable by the value 

      IMPORTANT!!:
        if no variable is set, then the math module will create the variable with a value of 0
  
  4 ~ Goto line|
               |
    Structure: 4 0
                 |
                 |
             Line number



  5 ~ If statement:
             |    
  Structure: 5 44 ? 1 < Value to use with operator
                ^ ^
                   \-> operator
         Variable     

  The if statement is one of the more complex modules, it uses 2 diffrent operators 
      
      All of the if statement operators are as follows:
        == ~ if Variable is equal to value then do
        != ~ if variable is not equal to value then do

      All code under the if statement only runs if the statement is true,
      What code can be used by the if statement, is any code between the if statement and a
      period (.) 
  

      Example:
        1 50 5 ~ makes varaible 50 = 5

        5 50 == 5 ~ if 50 equal to 5 Then do
          2 50 ~ print 50
        .
