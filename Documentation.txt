All functions to date:

  1 = set variable:
    1 50 10 ~ creates a variable nammed "50" with the value of 10

    to access variables in code, use 1,(variable Name), This lets helix know its a variable, and not a number

  2 = print number/variable:
    
    2 1,50 ~ Prints the value of a variable nammed "50"

    2 50 ~ prints the number 50

    2 50 1 ~ prints the number 50, on the same line

    2 50 2 ~ prints the ASCII character number 50 on a newline

    2 50 3 ~ prints the ASCII character number 50 on the same line

  
  3 - math:
    3 50 1,50 + 1 ~ sets variable 50 to the variable 50's value + 1

    Works with:
      + ~ Add
      - ~ Subtract
      * ~ Time's
      / ~ Divide


  4 - Goto Line:
    4 2 ~ goes to line 2 

    If line dosent exsist, it returns an error

  5 - If statment:
    5 1,50 == 10 ~ if variable 50 is equal to 10, run the code under the if statment

    'If statments' are contained in-between the line that the function is on, and a period

    'If statments' CANNOT overlap, im bad at coding so until i fix it, were stuck with this
    
    Example:

      5 1,50 == 10
        (Code inside here will run if above is true)
      .

    Current compare characters:

      == ~ If thing equals, run
      != ~ If thing does not equal, run
